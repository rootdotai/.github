With the press of a button, begin to record your front camera, upload the footage to the cloud in real-time, track your exact location, notify your emergency contacts through SMS and Whatsapp, and alert 911 if necessary. Emergency contacts (*and 911*) will receive a video and location livestream of the incident while also getting access to key information such as realtime updates of your battery life.
